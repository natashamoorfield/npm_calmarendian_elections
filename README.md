# Calmarendian Elections
## About
This Python library is intended to help readers of and contributors to the *Visions in Blue* project better understand Calmarendian democratic processes.

## Constitutional Arrangements
For some background on where this project is coming from you may find our guide to Calmarendian Government and Democracy of some assistance.

## The `npm_calmarendian_elections` Package
This package provides a number of Python classes and scripts which distil some rigorous definitions from the verbiage of “Government and Democracy”.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 (Should work with older versions but this is currently untested; feel free to open an issue if you are encountering problems.)
- [npm_calmarendian_date](https://github.com/natashamoorfield/npm_calmarendian_date) (`npm_calmarendian_elections` started life as a means of testing some features from `npm_calmarendian_date`.)

## Installation
<!--
We strongly recommend installing our packages in a virtual environment rather than cluttering up your system'S Python installation with all this junk.

`pip install npm_calmarendian_elections`

or

`pip install -e git+https://github.com/natashamoorfield/npm_calmarendian_elections`
-->
*Documentation awaited. This project is still a work in progress and is not yet been prepared as an installable package.*

## Usage
To use `npm_calmarendian_elections` classes in your own projects…
```python
from npm_calmarendian_elections import Election

election = Election(777, 7)
```

## Running the Scripts
Good luck with that; we’re working on it.
